Hi,Im a student of the prestigious college of engineering trivandrum(CET),sreekaryam.
This repository consist of all my basic lab programs in python language. python is the most simple and easiest language to use from personal experience as i have used c,c++ and java.
I hope this may prove useful to someone out there whose in the initial stage of learning the language.
